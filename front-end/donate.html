                    <p style=" text-align:justify; line-height:29px;">Health aid donations in Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement focus on improving medical care, preventing disease, and supporting the health needs of refugees and nearby host communities. These donations come from international organizations, governments, and NGOs working together under Uganda’s refugee health response.</p>  
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Medical supplies and medicines:</strong> Donated drugs, vaccines, and hospital equipment (such as beds, gloves, syringes, and protective gear) are supplied by partners like WHO, UNICEF, and UNHCR.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Health facility support:</strong> Construction and renovation of health centers and maternity wards funded by donors such as the European Union, UNHCR, and Malteser International.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Maternal and child health:</strong> Donations fund prenatal checkups, safe delivery kits, nutrition supplements, and vaccinations for children under five.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Training of medical staff:</strong> Health workers and refugee volunteers receive training in emergency response, maternal health, and disease control through donor-supported programs.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Mental health and psychosocial support:</strong> NGOs like the Danish Refugee Council and TPO Uganda provide counseling and trauma-healing sessions funded by international aid agencies.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH):</strong> Health-related donations often include clean water systems, latrines, and hygiene kits to prevent cholera, malaria, and other diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Emergency response:</strong> Health aid covers outbreak control (e.g., malaria, COVID-19, measles) and vaccination drives with support from WHO and the Ministry of Health.</li>

                    <p style=" text-align:justify; line-height:29px;">Money donations in Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement are used to support refugees’ daily needs, promote self-reliance, and strengthen local markets. Instead of only receiving food or goods, refugees can use the money to make their own choices and improve their livelihoods.</p>  

                <ul>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Food and essentials:</strong> Refugees buy food (maize, beans, vegetables, oil) and household items like soap, clothes, and cooking fuel.</li>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Livelihoods and small businesses:</strong> Some use grants to start micro-businesses such as tailoring, farming, or selling goods in local markets.</li>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Support for vulnerable groups:</strong> Pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities receive targeted cash to cover health, nutrition, or basic needs.</li>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Education and school costs:</strong> Families use part of the donations for school uniforms, books, and exam fees.</li>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Community impact:</strong> The cash circulates in local Ugandan markets, boosting the host community economy and supporting small traders.</li>
                    <li><strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Challenges:</strong> Price inflation, lack of mobile money agents, and funding shortages can limit the effectiveness of cash donations.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="donation-div2-2"> <strong>WHAT FOOD AND RATION DONATION DOES</strong>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <strong style=" color:#0A4D8C;">Refugees</strong> at Rhino Camp receive monthly food rations (corn/maize flour, beans, oil, salt) distributed through agencies like World Food Programme (WFP) and World Vision Uganda.
                                <br><em>Example:</em> Some households reported doing only one meal a day because they lacked firewood to cook despite the food rations.

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                    Although donations are being received, there are still funding gaps: 
                                    <em>e.g., a report noted that for Uganda refugees, only ~13 % of required funds had been received in a given appeal.</em>
                                </li>
                
                                <li> 
                                    There are logistical and structural challenges: Even when food is donated, some refugees cannot cook it due to firewood 
                                    shortage or have to barter food for firewood.
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    Integration with host-community needs is emphasised (e.g., agro-forestry where 70% refugees + 30% host community) to reduce tension and share resources.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Some support is targeted (e.g., pregnant women, youth, etc), so not all households receive the exact same support. 
                                </li>
                        </ol>
